# jWordle
Slightly unstable implementation of Wordle in Java.

This is basically what the description says - a kind of buggy Wordle game you can play in your terminal. All you have to do is type `java WordleClone` and the fun begins. I don't really have too much to say about this one except that you can report bugs in the issues tab. There are some I know about, and am trying to think of a fix for. Showers generally help with that.
